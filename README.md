# Gemini Mongoose Seeder
Mongoose seeders are not great and not very flexible.  Sometimes you just want some random data tossed into your ODM!

Gemini is a CLI utility that will setup a basic seeder for you and provides you access to casual.js, a library that generates random data for your collections.

## Getting started

To get started with Gemini, you simply need to install the package globally `npm i -g gemini-mongoose`.

Once the install is complete, run `gemini init` to setup all the nessesary files to configure Gemini

## Contribute

Why i'm glad you asked, sure!  It would be super bad ass if you can shape this package to be even better!  Be a champ and submit a PR!

... more to come in this readme!
